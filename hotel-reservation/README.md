**a. Problem Statement**


The hospitality industry faces significant revenue loss due to booking cancellations. 
Last-minute cancellations make it difficult for hotels to resell rooms, leading to inventory inefficiency and lost income. 
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning solution that predicts the likelihood of a booking being canceled based on customer profiles and reservation details. 


By identifying high-risk bookings in advance, hotel management can -: 
*   Implement targeted retention strategies (e.g., confirmation calls)
*   Optimize overbooking policies to maintain maximum occupancy.
*   Improve revenue forecasting and resource allocation.

This is a Binary Classification problem where the target is to predict if a booking status will be Canceled (1) or Not_Canceled (0).
